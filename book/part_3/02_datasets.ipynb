        "# Datasets for automix systems\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will first discuss the datasets used to train the automix systems. Thereafter, we will see how to pre-process the data and set up the dataloaders for training the deep learning models for these systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Training automix models requires paired multitrack stems and their corresponding mixdowns. Below listed are the desired properties for these datasets:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. __Time alligned stems and mixes__ : We require time-alligned stems and mixes to allow the models to learn timewise transformation relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. __Diverse instrument categories__ : The more diverse the number of instruments in the dataset, the more likely is the trained system to perform well with real-world songs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. __Diverse genres of songs__ : The mixing practices vary slightly from one genre to another. Hence, if the dataset has multitrack mixes from different genres, the trained system will be exposed to more diverse distribution of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. __Dry multitrack stems__ : Mixing involves processing the recorded dry stems for corrective and aesthetic reasons before summing them to form a cohesive mixture. For a model to learn the correct way to process the stems to generate mixes, we need to train it on dry unprocessed stems and mix pairs. However, more recently approaches to use processed stems from datasets like MUSEDB to train automix systems have been explored. These approaches use a pre-processing effect normalisation method to deal with pre-processed wet stems. For the scope of this tutorial, we do not discuss these methods. However, we recommend having a look at [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11428) paper being presented at ISMIR 2022."

However, it is likely that some of the multitrack stem or the mix as a whole could have just silence in this chunk of loaded audio. This results in generation of NaN in the audio tensor when it is normalised. In the below shown code block, we show how to check for silence. We keep generating a new starting index(`offset`)) for loading the audio until the audio has some content and is not just silence(`silent is False`).\n",
