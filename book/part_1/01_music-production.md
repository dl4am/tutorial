# Music Production

Music production is a multi-dimensional creative process. It encompasses developing, creating and refining recorded material into a body of finished work. This defines the entire life cycle of a piece of music. 
From composition to sound recording and editing through to mixing and mastering. 
Mixing is just a single role in the music production process and often takes place after the recording and editing of a song. 
After the process of mixing, a mastering stage is often undertaken to apply the final steps necessary for distribution.
