# Mixing

Mixing can be loosely defined as the process of taking recorded tracks and blending them together. Tracks are blended using various processes facilitated by audio effects processing such as equalization, compression, distortion and various spatial effects such as reverberation. The goal of mixing various elements together is to subjectively create a mix by adjusting levels, panning, frequency content and dynamics via various audio effects. A mix goes through a life cycle as seen in the screenshots taken from our session. We demonstrate some of these principles using the song Flare by the Swedish band Isolate. Figure \ref{logicmix} shows Apple Logic Pro's mix page for the song which includes faders for adjusting relative levels between instruments and panpots for adjusting panorama of sounds within the stereo field. In our videos that accompany this tutorial we illustrate this point with the adjustment of the aforementioned parameters along with the manipulation of Equalisation (EQ), Dynamic Range Compression (DRC) and Reverberation. In addition, in the following sections, we will introduce the mixing tools from the standpoint of signal processing.
